# Arty-A7-35T
Projects which can be used on the Arty A7-35T board

This repository serves as a single location for Arty A7-35T projects. I hope to build this repository with both VHDL and Verilog examples. Its purpose is to help me learn how to implement various functions for FPGAs. I want to grow my skill base so that I can use FPGAs in the future in very practical ways.
